  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>
    I am a software developer working for the <a href="http://fa.oregonstate.edu/bic/core" target="_blank">CORE</a> team at Oregon State University. Our team develops and maintains a reporting application that provides business intellignce for staff and faculty across campus. My typical responsibilities include data analytics, data visualization, and user interface (UI) design for our application.
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from Oregon State University in 2015 with a Bachelors in Computer Science. Since then, I've had a taste of working all around the software stack. Some of my various projects have involved:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data analysis and dashboard design</li>
    <li>Front end web development</li>
    <li>Back end web development</li>
    <li>Linux and Solaris system administration</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When I'm not at work, I'm probably playing the bass guitar, learning about cars, or making improvements to this website. I started this project in June 2017 and there are still many things I'd like to add (if I'm honest, I don't think I'll ever be finished). If you like what you see, check back regularly because I try to write a little something every month. Thanks for stopping by!
