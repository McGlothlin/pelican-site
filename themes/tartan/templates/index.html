  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>
    I am a software developer working for the <a href="http://fa.oregonstate.edu/bic/core" target="_blank">CORE</a> team at Oregon State University. Our team develops and maintains a reporting application that provides business intellignce for staff and faculty across campus.
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from Oregon State University in 2015 with a Bachelors in Computer Science. Since then, I've had a taste of working all around the software stack. Some of my various projects have involved:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data analysis and dashboard design (SQL and Google Visualization)</li>
    <li>Front end web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)</li>
    <li>Back end web development (Drupal)</li>
    <li>Linux and Solaris system administration (Ansible and Docker)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When I'm not at work, I'm probably playing the bass guitar or learning about cars; there's much to know and I'm new to the scene.
