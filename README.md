# pelican-site

A personal website powered by [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com).

## What is this?

This project is a blog that allows me to write about my interests, but it's also much more than that. I use this site as a sandbox for learning and experimentation with various web technologies and practices. The site uses a custom theme I wrote using CSS3 and jQuery. I've tried to minimize the use of external libraries and do as much of it by hand as I can with the goal of furthering myself as a web developer and keeping my skills relevant in an ever-changing industry. I'm constantly rewriting functional aspects of the design as I figure out better ways of doing the same thing.

## Why Pelican?

Pelican uses [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org), a template engine for Python, to eliminate the need for the tedious writing of HTML pages tag by tag. This gives the site a consistent structure with a simple DOM that is less error prone. You build out the structure and Pelican fills in the boilerplate.

## Web development without a database

In the past I developed websites using a full-blown Content Management System (CMS), but I found most CMSes to be needlessly complex for my use case. I also work with databases all day at my current job and I thought I'd switch things up a bit; I want to maintain a well-rounded skillset.

## I welcome your feedback

Feel free to take a look at the site and let me know what you think! I'm constantly looking to improve my skills as a developer so constructive feedback is always welcome.
