# pelican-site
A personal website using Pelican, a static site generator.

This project is a sandbox for experimentation with web technologies and best practices.
My personal goal is for it to be as fast and light as possible, while remaining aesthetically pleasing in both a mobile and desktop environment.
I also intend to turn it into a regularly updated blog once I tweak it to my liking.
The live site can be found at https://seanmcglothlin.com.
