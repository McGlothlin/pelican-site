When I was very young, I remember admiring people who could play an instrument. The thought that a human could pull a bundle of horse hair across a string or blow into a pipe to make beautiful melodies was such a foreign concept to me, and being a kid from a small town in Alaska with non-musical parents led to an assumption I would never have the chance to learn.

This could not have been further from the truth.

When my family moved to Oregon, I saw that my new school district's music program was very good. In the 3rd grade, part of the music curriculum involved buying a [recorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorder_(musical_instrument)){:target="\_blank"} and learning the very basics of music theory. The following year, a "strings" program was made available for 4th and 5th graders. This was a district-wide program that was available until students graduated high school, where students could learn to play the violin, [viola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola){:target="\_blank"}, or [cello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello){:target="\_blank"} and walk away with a solid foundation in music theory and live performance skills in both a group and solo setting.

When I told my parents I would like to be involved in this program, they were very supportive of my decision... so long as I didn't pick the cello. "That's too bad", I thought; that would've been my first pick! They told me it was too hard to transport and too expensive. Sounded like a fair compromise to me, and I wasn't paying for it anyway so I was willing to take what I could get. A childhood friend of mine had been playing the violin since she was three years old, so I chose the violin to follow suit.

### You don't know what note that is?

In the 6th grade, my English class read a book about a kid who sang in a boys' choir and discovered he had [absolute pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_pitch){:target="\_blank"}. The language in the book really confused me... why were people getting so excited about a task as menial as identifying which note you're listening to? I started reading this very article I've linked for you from Wikipedia.

It was at that moment I realized this was not something everyone could do.

Perhaps this is why I've always felt an intimate connection to music that I struggle to put into words. It's as if the notes are my friends, the timbre and articulation their quirks and personalities. This astonishing realization that I was a rare breed changed my relationship with music forever. Armed with the knowledge that my aural ability made me a part of the musical "one percent", I felt it was my duty to exercise that gift and to share it with others.

And share it I did. I started playing music at my local church, which was a huge part of my life during the latter half of high school and continues to be relevant to this day. I stuck with the school orchestra until I graduated, but not without picking up several other instruments on the side: the guitar, [upright bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bass){:target="\_blank"} (when they needed someone to fill in for a concert), viola, and most importantly of all, the [bass guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar){:target="\_blank"}. The bass guitar was my first true love. Sorry, Nikki.

### The bass guitar

When I was a sophomore in high school, one of my best friends decided he wanted to start a band. He was really into guitar and needed a bassist. I agreed and eventually acquired my first bass guitar, a [Squier jazz bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Jazz_Bass){:target="\_blank"}. Armed with my music theory background and the ability to know the notes of any song I listen to, I quickly picked up the new instrument from [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bass+guitar+tutorial){:target="\_blank"} and lots of practice. The band didn't work out, but I enjoyed the bass so much I never stopped playing. In fact I played so much that some might consider me to be pretty OK at it. I don't often see people cover their ears, which seems like a good sign (there is, however, a funny story behind that which I'll leave for [another post](onstage-blunders.html); it was one of my greatest onstage blunders).

That brings me to where I am today. I am thoroughly convinced that the bass and I were made for each other, and I've been playing it almost exclusively since I left high school. My favorite way to practice is to pick a song I like and just start playing it. Sometimes I'll practice with friends (a.k.a. "[jamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session){:target="\_blank"}") but we're just out to have fun; our sessions usually devolve into banging out some rock or metal as loud as we can get away with, which ends up sounding more like a ruckus than music, but that's okay.

I am open to the possiblity of gigging or joining a band. If you're looking for a bassist for a jazz, rock, or metal band, I may be interested. Perhaps you're looking for someone to play a one-time gig, or maybe you just want to jam for fun. In any case, please feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smcglothlin){:target="\_blank"} and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
