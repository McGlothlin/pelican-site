This is my wife's 1998 Toyota Corolla. It's not a car that first comes to mind when you think of something a car enthusiast might buy. It made 120 horsepower when it was new and this particular example has an automatic transmission.

Not very sporty.

Nikki is completely fine with this, because she's not an enthusiast. What she really wanted was to put her car through its paces and learn how it handled at the limit; that knowledge comes in handy in an emergency situation.

A couple weeks ago we went autocrossing with the [Emerald Empire Sports Car Club](http://www.eescc.org/){:target="\_blank"}. They had two events that weekend (lucky me!) so I took my Miata on Saturday, then brought my wife and her Corolla on Sunday. This was actually my first time autocrossing either car, and her first time autocrossing ever. She was understandably nervous.

Saturday was actually my second autocross ever, so I ran as a novice. This was a good move, because I got the full novice experience and could tell her what it was like on the drive down to Eugene.

EESCC has an excellent novice program. They have a dedicated novice coordinator who helps you along as the event progresses. The novice coordinator makes sure you have everything you need and takes most of the guesswork and uncertainty out of the experience. Additionally, novices run in the second half of the event and don't work the course - during the first half, they ride along with experienced drivers instead. This helps newbies learn the course, understand the grid, and calm their nerves.

I use a very loose definition of "calm" here. Flying around a parking lot is exhilarating and just makes you excited to try it yourself!

###Running the course

When it came time to drive, I ran first. It had been so long since I walked the course that I got lost and took a turn through the wrong gate. It was a good teaching moment for Nikki.
