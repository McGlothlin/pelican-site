This site is written using Pelican, a Static Site Generator. I chose Pelican because it's a nice change of pace from the feature-saturated CMS sites I've worked with in the past. These sites are often slow and prone to security vulnerabilities, neither of which I care too much for. There's nothing wrong with a good CMS, of course, but didn't make sense for this minimal use case. Pelican is also written in Python, which I am partial to.
